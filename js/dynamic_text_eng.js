var deadpoolv1 = "<b>Deadpool</b> was created by <b>Rob Liefeld</b>, making his first appearance in #98 of the New Mutants from 1991, written by <b>Fabian Nicieza</b>. He appeared as a synthesis of multiple chracters which interested <b>Liefeld</b> at the time resulting in a talkative mercenary, armed with swords, guns, an extraordinay healing factor coupled with an ugly mug and a defective teleportation belt. This is the version kept for different appearences and two miniseries, none of which remarked itself through humor or metatextuality, other than the main characters mean spirited pop-culture references from his dialogue, which were more of an warped verion of Spidey's trademark banter."

var animalman_deadpoolv2 = "In <b>Animal Man</b>, <b>Grant Morrison</b> took a minor character, using him to comment on the nature of superhero stories. There are numerous antecendets for this, but the metafictional play with comics' language, which could for the most part still be explained by the stories metaphysics or by the character's altered mental state, opened the gates for the kind of comic <b>Deadpool</b> would become.";

var deadpoolv2 = "Under <b>Joe Kelly</b> and <b>Ed McGuinness</b> the comi becomes humorous in nature, without becoming a full-un comedy, placing it's character in the place of a reluctant hero, with often fits of violence. To counterpoint <b>Deadpool's</b> insanity, the authors grow around him a recurring cast of characters who present him with moral dillemas. They also introduce a slightly more self-aware narration from Wade's point of view and punctual plays with the comics's language, such as in issues 11, where <b>Deadpool</b> and <b>Blind Al</b> are transported back in time and drew in the style <b>John Romita Jr.</b> would have used to drew his issues of <b>The Amazing Spider-Man</b> that would have happened at the time. It's worth noting that at the around the same time, <b>Garth Ennis</b> and <b>John McCrea</b> were taking a similar route at <b>DC</b> with <b>Hitman</b>.";
